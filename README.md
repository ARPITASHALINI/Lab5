# Analyzing Airport Data

This assignment is completed for Programming for GIS course.In this assignment I analyzed the airport data which was downloaded from [OpenFlights Project](https://openflights.org/data.html) and used Python on Google Colab to solve various challeneges set by our Professor. 

The first challenge walks us through how to import files which are present on our local drive. The next challenge expects us to create two dictionaries containing latitudes and longitudes respectively. The next chalenge wants us to calculate the distances of the routes of the flights. The final challenge wants us to create a histogram between the distance of the routes in km and the number of flights. The final output looks like this:
